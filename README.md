# tetris
Tetris is a classic, tile-matching puzzle game that involves both careful planning and split second decisions. Different 4-Square tile pieces (Tetrominos) are repeatedly dropped from the top of the screen. The player attempts to keep the tiles from filling up the entire screen by matching an entire row, clearing it from the game.
